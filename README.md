# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to look at earthquakes in the last 7 days and their magnitude. We then also created overlays to show the tectonic plates and how they relate to each other. We also added other map layers for easy visualization and pop ups with location and magnitude of each earthquake.

## Conclusion
The earthquakes line up with the tectonic plates. More data would be needed to see further trends on time of year, magnitude and locations.
