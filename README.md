# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to identify earthquakes over the past 7 days as well as their intensity. 

## Process
First we got familiar with plotly and geoJSON. We ploted multiple points and added pop up markers that displayed information. We also worked with creating different branches and merging those branches when the time was right.

## Conclusion
The final map shows all earthquakes in the last 7 days with their intensity measured by the size and color of a circle marker. We added different layer options to the map and a legend defining the circle markers and colors vs magnitude of the earthquakes
